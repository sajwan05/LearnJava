You need to know how to program in order to tell computer what to do

“ Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a
 computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining
 to human beings what we want a computer to do. ”
                                                -Don Knuth

There are multiple languages by which we can talk to computer like FORTRAN,C,C++,Javascript,Python,Ruby but here we're choosing java.

Just choose one language ,language doesn't matter!

“ There are only two kinds of
programming languages: those
people always [gripe] about and
those nobody uses.”
                    -Bjarne Stroustrup
